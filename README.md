This repository contains different tasks(Task-1 to Task-7) on different topics of Machine Learning algorithms. done in the internship.
They are:

**Task 1: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
     **Objective:** Learn how to clean and prepare raw data for ML.
     
**Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
     **Objective:** Understand data using statistics and visualizations.

**Task 3: Linear Regression**
     **Objective:** Implement and understand simple & multiple linear regression.

**Task 4: Classification with Logistic Regression.**
     **Objective:** Build a binary classifier using logistic regression. 

**Task 5: Decision Trees and Random Forests**
     **Objective:** Learn tree-based models for classification & regression. 

**Task 6: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification**
