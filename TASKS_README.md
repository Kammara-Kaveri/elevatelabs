Breast Cancer Classification using Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Project Overview
This project applies Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify whether a tumor is benign or malignant using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset. It covers both linear and non-linear (RBF kernel) SVMs and demonstrates how to tune hyperparameters for optimal performance


Dataset
Source: Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset

Features: Mean radius, mean texture, mean smoothness, etc.

Target: 0 = malignant, 1 = benign

Tools & Libraries
Python
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
Seaborn

Steps Performed
Data Loading
Used scikit-learnâ€™s built-in breast cancer dataset.

Preprocessing
Selected 2 features for 2D visualization
Split into train-test sets
Standardized features

Model Training
Trained SVM with both linear and RBF kernel
Evaluated accuracy and generated classification reports

Visualization
Plotted decision boundaries to visualize how SVM separates classes

Hyperparameter Tuning
Used GridSearchCV to tune C and gamma
Selected best model using cross-validation

ðŸ“Š Results
Accuracy (Linear SVM): ~96%
Accuracy (RBF SVM after tuning): ~97-98%

Best Parameters:
{'C': 10, 'gamma': 0.01, 'kernel': 'rbf'}

Visualizations
Decision boundary of SVM in 2D feature space
Classification report showing precision, recall, F1-score

What I Learned
How SVM maximizes margin to classify data
The kernel trick for non-linear separation
The importance of hyperparameter tuning
Visualization of decision regions

 Future Improvements
Apply to a multiclass dataset
Use other kernels (polynomial, sigmoid)
Integrate pipeline and save model using joblib
