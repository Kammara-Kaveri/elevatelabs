 ## Task 1: Data Preprocessing
 **Objective:**
 
To clean and prepare raw data so it's suitable for machine learning models. This includes handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical data.

**What I Did:**

Loaded a sample dataset using Pandas

Identified and filled or dropped missing values

Used Label Encoding / One-Hot Encoding for categorical variables

Applied StandardScaler to normalize numerical features

Split the dataset into training and testing sets

**Libraries Used:**

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-learn (for preprocessing tools)

**Key Concepts I Learned:**

Why preprocessing is important before training a model

How to handle null values and non-numeric data

The impact of scaling features
Importance of splitting data to avoid overfitting

Output:
A clean, ready-to-use dataset that can now be fed into any ML model.
