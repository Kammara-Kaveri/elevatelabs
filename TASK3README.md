## Task 3: Linear Regression

**Objective:**

To implement and evaluate a linear regression model to predict a continuous target variable based on input features.

**What I Did:**

Loaded a dataset suitable for regression tasks (like predicting prices or scores)

Performed data preprocessing and feature selection

Built a Linear Regression model using Scikit-learn

Trained the model on training data and predicted on test data

Evaluated the model using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² Score

Visualized the regression line for better understanding

**Libraries Used:**

Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib

**Key Concepts I Learned:**

How linear regression finds the best-fit line to model the data

The difference between underfitting and overfitting

What MSE and R² Score indicate about model performance

How to interpret coefficients in a regression model

**Output:**

A trained linear regression model along with performance metrics that show how well it predicts continuous outcomes.
