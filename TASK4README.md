Task 4: Logistic Regression
Objective:
To use logistic regression to classify data into categories (e.g., yes/no, 0/1) and evaluate the performance of the model.

What I Did:
Loaded a binary classification dataset
Preprocessed the data (handled missing values, encoding, scaling)
Built a Logistic Regression model using Scikit-learn
Trained the model and made predictions on the test set
Evaluated results using Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, and Classification Report
Interpreted the probability outputs and decision boundary (if applicable)

Libraries Used:
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib / Seaborn (for plots)

Key Concepts I Learned:
How logistic regression models the probability of a binary outcome
The role of the sigmoid function
How to evaluate classifiers using precision, recall, and F1-score
How to interpret classification results beyond just accuracy

Output:
A trained classifier that can predict binary outcomes and a clear understanding of how well it performs across different evaluation metrics.
