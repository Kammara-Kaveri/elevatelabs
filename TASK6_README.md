Task 7: Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Objective:
To build an SVM classifier for both linear and non-linear data and understand how the kernel trick and margin maximization work.

What I Did:
Used the Breast Cancer dataset for binary classification
Preprocessed the data (encoding, scaling, splitting)
Trained an SVM using both linear and RBF (non-linear) kernels
Visualized decision boundaries using 2D plots
Tuned hyperparameters like C and gamma using GridSearchCV
Evaluated the model with accuracy and classification report

Libraries Used:
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib

Key Concepts I Learned:
How SVM separates classes using the maximum margin
The role of kernel functions for handling non-linearly separable data
How C and gamma affect the decision boundary and overfitting
The use of cross-validation and grid search for tuning models

Output:
A tuned and trained SVM model capable of classifying complex patterns in the data, along with clear visualizations and evaluation results.
