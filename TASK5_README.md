Task 5: Decision Tree Classification
Objective:
To use a Decision Tree model to classify data and understand how decisions are made through tree-like splits.

What I Did:
Loaded and preprocessed a classification dataset
Trained a Decision Tree Classifier using Scikit-learn
Visualized the structure of the decision tree
Evaluated model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
Tried different parameters like max_depth and criterion to observe changes in performance

Libraries Used:
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualizations)

Key Concepts I Learned:
How decision trees split data based on feature conditions
The difference between Gini impurity and Entropy
How to visualize and interpret a decision tree
Pros and cons of decision trees (e.g., prone to overfitting)

Output:
A trained decision tree model that can predict categorical outcomes, along with a visual tree structure that explains how decisions are made.
