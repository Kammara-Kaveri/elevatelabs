 Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
📝 Objective:
To understand the structure and patterns of the dataset through visualizations and summary statistics before building any models.

What I Did:
Loaded the dataset and checked for missing values
Explored the distribution of features using histograms and boxplots
Used correlation heatmaps to identify relationships between variables
Plotted graphs like count plots, scatter plots, and pair plots
Identified potential outliers and feature trends

Libraries Used:
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn

 Key Concepts I Learned:
How to quickly spot patterns, trends, and anomalies in data
Why visualizations help in deciding which features are important
The role of correlation in feature selection
How to interpret plots and make data-driven assumptions

Output:
A deeper understanding of the dataset and some initial hypotheses about which features might affect the target variable.
